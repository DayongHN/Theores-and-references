2017] Large-Scale Outdoor 3D Reconstruction on a Mobile Device
motion stereo

volumetric fusion

free-space measurements for filter outliers

extended kalman filter are used to propagate depth measurements in image space and their estimated uncertainteies over times

the components for camera pose tracking and depth map fusion 

use optical flow to compute high-quality depth maps from a monocular video sequence.
use sparse feature tracking to estimate the camera poses

plane sweep stereo

6Dof camera pose tracking(Visual-inertial odometry and Extended kalman filter)
depth map estimation (plane sweeping)
depth map fusion(volumetric fusion)

using an imu enables the tracking system to recover the absolute scale of the scene.
marching cubes algorithm
truncated signed distance function(TSDF) in the voxels
