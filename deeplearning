DINO V2

we learn our features with a discriminative self-supervised method that can be seen as a combination of
DINO and IBOT losses with centering of SWAV. we also add a regularizer to spread features and a short high-resolution training phase

Loss = =sum p_{teacher} log p_{student}

Koleo regularizer
  L_{koleo} = - 1\n sum log(d_{n, i}) where d_{n, i} = minj=i||x_i - x_j||
